# Learning-Data-Science
Learning and studying Data Science post General Assembly Data Science Immersive course. This repository contains learning materials from various online educational resources. 

03/01/2022 - I've been working on "Python Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" course instructed by Jose Portilla on Udemy as a review course post General Assembly DSI since 2nd week of Feb.! I have a separate private repository being updated for notes and projects. Upon checking whether I can safely upload some of my projects into this public repository without any legal issues, I will update this repo.   

03/03/2022 - I completed Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp from Udemy taught by instructor Jose M. Portilla. I intend to clean up my notes and start posting on GitHub as well as working on producing solutions to HackerRank SQL challenge questions. (p.s. I've already completed Basic and Intermediate level certificates) To be continued.
