Learning and studying Data Science post General Assembly Data Science Immersive course. This repository contains learning materials from various online educational resources. 

03/01/2022 - I've been working on "Python Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" course instructed by Jose Portilla on Udemy as a review course post General Assembly DSI since 2nd week of Feb.! I have a separate private repository being updated for notes and projects. Upon checking whether I can safely upload some of my projects into this public repository without any legal issues, I will update this repo.
